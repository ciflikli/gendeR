The question here is whether the state can and should have a permanently fixed exchange rate or whether it should have the discretion to adjust the exchange rate peg. As you read, keep that debate at the forefront of your minds...........Here's a hint for those of you (particularly in IR450) who remember this debate in Bretton Woods: John Locke is to Harry Dexter White as William Lowdnes is to JM Keynes (kind of!)...........Just read the following...........Start reading at this sentence: 'SILVER is the Instrument and Measure of Commerce in all the Civilized and Trading parts of the World.'..........Stop reading at this sentence: 'The Exchange is High, when a Man pays for Bills of Exchange above the Par.
